# Quasimorph Raid Show Ally

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

Changes the mission start button to include the faction that the player is raiding for.

With the new reverse mission functionality, this is a quick check that the player is choosing the desired side.  Especially useful when the player exits the raid dialog and returns.
