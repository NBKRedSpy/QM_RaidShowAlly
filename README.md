# Quasimorph Raid Show Ally

# Important - This version of the mod is only for the opt in beta version of the game!

This is a temporary version that supports the 0.8.6 beta, and not the current game's version.
For the non beta version of the game, use the mod of the same name without the BETA suffix.

The non beta version *must* be uninstalled.  
When the 0.8.6 becomes the main version, this mod will be deleted.
Note that the beta is expected to change many times before release.
As such, this mod may break on each beta release.

# Docs


Changes the mission start button to include the faction that the player is raiding for.

With the new reverse mission functionality, this is a quick check that the player is choosing the desired side.  Especially useful when the player exits the raid dialog and returns.
